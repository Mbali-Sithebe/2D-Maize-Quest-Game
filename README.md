# 2D Maize Quest Game
Maize Adventure is a 2D maze game where players must complete four mazes to win. Each maze offers three entry paths; choosing the shortest one triggers tricky quiz challenges that must be solved to move past obstacles. Players must complete three quizzes within a time limit, with both maze and quiz difficulty increasing as they progress.
